To support you with the portfolio task, we have now provided a basic version of the
webapp which has all the required features - if you haven't been able to get your
code working, you can use this to run your pilot study. It is linked in the
Portfolio - Support document, which also contains templates for submission 
(in two formats: you only need to complete one of them). 
You need to fork this code in order to access the metrics and make changes.

In addition, there is a basic checklist which gives all of the components of planning
and running your pilot study - this might be useful if you're still struggling to get
started.

This isn't a replacement for understanding the code, and you do need to spend time 
looking through the notes if you have not already - next semester we will do a quick
intro to setting up your own web apps but we will assume some level of basic
familiarity.


The full specification of the portfolio task is given in the HCI book and you should 
refer to this as it has the full instructions, including some useful details about 
what you need to submit for evidence and links to different parts of the notes 
related to each section.


Your evidence and write up should be uploaded to Gradescope, 
with a suggested deadline of the 5th December and a final late deadline of the 12th. Unlike the Wordle task, you do not need to have this marked in labs.
