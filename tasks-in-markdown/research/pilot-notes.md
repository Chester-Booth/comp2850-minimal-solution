| 14:23 | T3   | Participant hesitated before submitting—unsure if 'Enter' or button | ux-feedback    |
| 14:25 | T3   | Success message not noticed initially                               | a11y-status    |

| 14:27 | T1   | Screen reader announced "Showing 3 tasks" ✓                         | a11y-pass      |
| 14:29 | T2   | Clicked Edit, validation error triggered (blank submission)         | error-handling |
| 14:30 | T2   | Recovered from error, completed successfully                        | resilience     |

Debrief notes:
- "I liked that the filter worked without clicking a button"
- "I wasn't sure the edit saved—maybe make the message more obvious?"
- SR announced status messages correctly throughout
