# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant 0
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Context**: [e.g., Uses keyboard only, prefers dark mode, has ADHD]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I use Notion for uni work. Last week I had to find all tasks tagged 'COMP2850' to prepare for a deadline. It took ages because the filter kept resetting."

**Observations**:
- Mentioned filter UX issue (cognitive load)
- Time pressure context (deadline stress)
- Tag-based workflow (not just chronological)

**Themes**: `filter_persistence`, `cognitive_load`, `deadline_anxiety`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "When I submit a form and nothing happens—like, did it save? I have to refresh the whole page to check."

**Observations**:
- Lack of confirmation feedback
- Low trust in interface
- Workaround = page reload (inefficient)

**Themes**: `status_feedback`, `confirmation`, `trust`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Yeah, I once forgot to submit coursework because it was buried in my list. I wish there was a way to pin urgent things."

**Observations**:
- List length issue (visibility)
- Prioritisation need
- Consequence = missed deadline (high impact)

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `visibility`, `urgent_tasks`

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "My trackpad broke last month. I tried using Tab to navigate, but some buttons were impossible to reach. Had to borrow a friend's mouse."

**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only experience = friction
- Temporary impairment (broken hardware)
- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `temporary_impairment`, `button_accessibility`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "Haven't tried eyes closed, but in sunlight I can't read low-contrast text. I increase zoom but then the layout breaks."

**Observations**:
- Contrast issue (situational disability)
- Zoom breaks responsive design
- Environmental factor (sunlight)

**Themes**: `contrast`, `zoom`, `responsive_design`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "A way to see progress—like, 'You've completed 8 out of 12 tasks this week.' That would motivate me."

**Observations**:
- Motivation through feedback
- Progress visualisation
- Weekly scope (not just daily)

**Themes**: `progress_tracking`, `motivation`, `feedback`

---

### Summary (Participant 0)
**Top pain points**:
1. Filter resets → cognitive overload
2. No confirmation feedback → uncertainty
3. Keyboard navigation gaps → temporary exclusion
4. Contrast issues in bright light → situational disability

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm filtering tasks, I want the selection to persist across page reloads so I don't lose my place."
- "When I submit a form, I want immediate confirmation so I know it worked without refreshing."
- "When my mouse breaks, I want full keyboard access so I can still complete tasks."

## Participant A
**Date**: [2025-12-03 23:05]
**Context**: [partially sighted]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed in writing 
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "The last time I used my task manager was this morning. I rely on it every day to juggle work tasks, my kids’ school activities, and household chores. For example, today I used it to check my reminders for a doctor’s appointment and a staff meeting, and to make sure I packed my kids’ lunchboxes on time. It really helps me feel more in control, especially since I can adjust font sizes and even use voice commands when my eyes are tired."

**Observations**:
- Used daily (routine actions) 
- Different modes (work/personal)
- Gives user agency (gives control)

**Themes**: `core_routine`, `cross-context`, `self_agency`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you when using task managers?
**Response**: "One of my main frustrations is when apps aren’t designed with accessibility in mind. For instance, sometimes the contrast between text and background isn’t strong enough, which makes it hard for me to read. Another issue is when the app requires too much precision, like tiny buttons or swipe gestures, which can be challenging if I’m not seeing well that day. Also, some apps don’t handle recurring tasks very well—I want more flexibility to customise schedules without adding the same thing repeatedly."

**Observations**:
- Flexible Tasks (recurring) are hard 
- Difficult if its low Contrast 
- gesture navigation issues

**Themes**: `self_agency`, `contrast`, `gesture navigation`

---

### Q3: Have you ever lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Oh, definitely! Losing track of an important task has happened to me before, especially when I’ve added it to the wrong category or forgotten to set a reminder. One time, I completely missed a deadline for my son’s school project because I had marked it under the wrong date. It made me feel terrible, and now I double-check everything. I wish task managers had smarter alerts or maybe even a feature that highlights tasks based on urgency or importance automatically."

**Observations**:
- incorrect inputting (editing)
- emotional distress from user-error
- higher quality alerts (foresight)

**Themes**: `user_error`, `emotional_distress`, `foresight`

---

### Q4: Have you ever used a task manager without a mouse?
**Response**: "Yes, I’ve used task managers without a mouse before, especially on my phone or tablet where I primarily rely on touch controls or voice commands. I also use keyboard shortcuts on my laptop when my eyes are strained—it’s quicker and reduces the effort to navigate tiny icons or menus. That said, not every app supports keyboard shortcuts well, which can be frustrating. I think a truly inclusive task manager should work seamlessly with multiple input methods."

**Observations**:
- keyboard usage 
- touch controls 
- small icons

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `icon_visibility`, `shortcuts`

---

### Q5: Have you ever used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight?
**Response**: "Yes, I’ve used task managers in both situations! With my vision, I sometimes rely on voice commands or screen readers, which effectively let me use the app without needing to look at the screen. For example, I’ll ask my phone to add or check a reminder while I’m busy doing something else, like cooking. As for bright sunlight, it’s often a challenge because I struggle with screen glare and poor contrast. That’s why I prefer apps that offer a dark mode or high-contrast mode—it makes them a lot easier to see. "

**Observations**:
- screen readers utilised
- voice commands help 
- alternate themes

**Themes**: `theming`, `screen_reader`, `voice_commands`

---

### Q6: Is there one feature that you would add to a task manager?
**Response**: "If I could add one feature, I’d love a task manager that provides tailored accessibility suggestions. For instance, if it notices I'm often using voice commands or adjusting font sizes, it could recommend optimised settings like enabling high contrast or simplifying the layout. That kind of proactive support would save so much time"

**Observations**:
- dynamic suggestions for accessibility
- longer time frame (track changes) 
- highlight settings (don't hide features)

**Themes**: `accessbility`, `suggestions`, `settings`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. incorrect input → fix 
2. low Contrast → hard to read
3. keyboard usage → frustrating 
4. small icons → uncertainty in identification  


**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm inputting tasks, I want to be able to fix mistakes so I don't have to re-input the task because it would waste time."
- "When I'm viewing tasks, I want the content to have a high-enough contrast so I can read tasks without difficulty because low contrast makes it harder to see ."
- "When I'm navigating by a keyboard , I want to be able to perform all actions i can with a mouse so i do not lose any functionality because it would exclude people without the ability to use a mouse (economic/physical/social)."
- "When I'm using the app, I want to be able to be able to change the size of icons and headings so that i can more easily identify them because forced content sizes creates a permanent exclusion (low-vision)"
